summary = 'AWS examples for deploying a self-managed Ansible Automation Platform instance on EC2 and other AWS infrastructure.'
+++

These examples are intended to be modified and updated for individual uses as there is no one-size-fits-all deployment model for Ansible.  The  machine shapes, the database service, and networking configuration will all depend on organizational circumstances.

### Ansible Example

The Ansible example uses Ansible collections, like `amazon.aws` to deploy the AWS infrastructure to run AAP.

### CloudFormation Example

The CloudFormation example uses CF templates to deploy AWS infrastructure.
