### What is Incubated Content?

As part of the Ansible Content Lab, cloud automation content will be incubated and potentially mature info formalized content. Use cases accepted to the lab will undergo the incubation process where the content will be developed and nurtured in an open-source process. The result of incubation will be cloud automation content that delivers value to users. The content may continue the journey to becoming formalized content.
